description: Update all docs and specs
---

# Rules

- Update all Markdown docs and spec files, especially README, SPEC, TEST_SPEC and REMOTE_SPEC, considering all changes worth mentioning that are staged and those already committed but not yet reflected in the docs (check 10 last commits)
- if needed check the code to understand the changes
- Include documents in /docs directory
